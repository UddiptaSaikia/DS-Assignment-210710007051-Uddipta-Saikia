# Distributed Systems Assignment - Uddipta Saikia
This is the repository that I made for the Distributed Systems Assignment.

The `test.py` program is the first approach which does not take any input from the user and the sending or receiving of messages is hardcoded to construct a Lamport's Logical Clock.

The `test2.py` program is the second approach that I made which takes input from the user accordingly to constuct the Lamport's Logical Clock.
